This task allows you to emulate "Game of Life".

Note: begin file should be .bmp
	  You can download different initial generations 
	  in bmp format in the Internet
	  OR
	  You can use my sample "glider_gun.bmp"

You have to run exe file like this:
gameOfLife.exe --input "name of the begin file" 
			   --output "name of folder which will be frames written to" 
			   --max_iter "max amount of frames" (optional, infinity by default)
			   --dump_freq "frequency of creating frames" (optional)
