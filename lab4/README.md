# PROG_ITMO_SEM1
It is a programm which can change metainformation of mp3 files (ID3v2).

Try it by yourself - you have 3 commands:

1) main.exe --filepath=*file_path* --show    <=> shows all metainformation as a table

2) main.exe --filepath=*file_path* --get=TIT2    <=> show metainformation by exact tag (for example - TIT2)

3) main.exe --filepath=*file_path* --set=COMM --value="Text you want to become new metainformation"     <=> change metainformation on exact tag

If you want, you can use file "01.Dream On.mp3" as a sample!
